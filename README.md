# Handwritten_digit_recognition
•Developed a Deep Learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to identify handwritten digits,and increased the training set size by 200% through augmentation techniques, resulting in a 15% improvement in model robustness and a 10% increase in overall performance accuracy.
•Utilized the Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer for training the model, achieving accuracy improvements from 0.783 to 0.998 and reducing loss from 1.008 to 0.9743 over 10 epochs.
